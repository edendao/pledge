        I refuse to empower the forces of extraction with despair and innaction.
        I reject their doctrine and accept the path towards reconnection,
        regeneration, harmony and flourishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recognize myself as an expression of Mother Earth instead of separate
        from it, along with all its living beings, systems and rhythms. Just
        like a flower does not sprout out of the meadow, but is the meadow
        manifesting its nature as a flower.
      </p>
      <p>
        I choose to walk towards a future of hope, renewal, healing and
        co-creation. A future, where the expression of humanity is not one of
        destruction but a steward for the blossoming of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I declare my right to pursue a life unbound to an economy of extraction.
        A product of the maladaptive narratives of the past which have brought
        great destruction and suffering to life on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that the creation of a regenerative economy is not only
        possible but necessary for human prosperity to thrive in harmony with
        the rhythms of our world.

          It is from this holistic awareness of my being, that I vow to renew my
          relationship with life.
