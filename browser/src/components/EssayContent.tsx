        Or so we are told. Metaverse profiteers are everywhere, proselytizing
        commodified virtuality, colonizing open digital land for profit, and
        expanding the surface area of the digital sphere in lockstep with its
        capture. The Metaverse, led by Meta, acts as a monopoly, gating access
        to the length and breadth of the digital ecosystem through its congested
        and polluted chokepoints, taking what was once collective and ensuring
        it is bought, sold, measured, and speculated upon. The Metaverse expands
        as an invasive monoculture, assimilating ecosystems, displacing extant
        species, and enclosing digital abundance into enforced scarcity. The
        Metaverse we are handed is a shackles in disguise, the promise of a vast
        digital realm ruled under one banner, a shameless land grab for the
        commons of the future and the resources of the past. This is no
        Metaverse, this is a <b>monoverse</b>.

        But there are brighter dreams, of brighter technological futures. Dreams
        that do more than reclaim what has been lost; dreams that prefigure
        futures of plenty, that learn from the old and build cathedrals to
        collective wisdom and intelligence. That trade in promises of freedom
        from with invitations for freedom to. Futures of <b> polycentrism</b>,
        where resources are owned and governed by the many, and where false
        scarcity again gives way to the creation of common spaces,
        collectively-owned public infrastructure, and shared, self-sovereign
        worlds. Spaces of
        <b> plurality</b>, where choice is meaningful because difference is
        prized; all the better to create a resilient ecology of diverse
        co-existence. We propose these dreams and futures be gathered under a
        different banner.

        Origins of the Pluriverse
      </h2>
      <p>
        The origin of the term ‘pluriverse’ is itself plural. The word has its
        roots in decolonial theory, emerging from the Zapatista movement and
        taken forward by activists and academics alike, championed especially by
        the cultural anthropologist Arturo Escobar and the literary critic and
        theorist Walter Mignolo. The pursuit of pluriversality is{" "}
        <b>the embrace of a world in which many worlds may fit</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of top-down, it’s bottom-up. Instead of one-size-fits-all, it’s
        a diverse ecology. Instead of monoculture its pluriculture. Slowly,
        subtley, insidiously, our internet - and by extension one might argue,
        our minds - is being colonised by a single vision of what is possible.
        The territory is digital, but the risk of a world where only one world
        fits is real, and so we call for a rewilding - a reinvigorating, a
        return of vitality, to the intimate spaces we connect, explore and think
        in. Our digital commons is not for sale.
      </p>
      <p>
        The history of the term is an oppositional one - it was birthed in
        response to the single, globalized Western system of being, a
        never-ending juggernaut of assimilation and monopoly over society
        itself. Those organizing under the term ‘pluriverse’ aimed to counter
        the universal - not with a disregard of all things universal, but with
        an embrace of ‘many universals’. We can see this not as a movement
        entirely away from the necessity of scale, but one that embraces
        federation and subsidiarity as well as one that requires many worlds to
        exist ‘at scale’ - pluricultures, not monocultures. Thus, the pluriverse
        arrays itself <i>against</i> universality as much as it is <i>for</i>{" "}
        plurality and epistemic diversity. It is for this reason that we believe
        it can act as an appropriate foundation for a socio-digital ecosystem -
        one that must both oppose / critique and create / imagine.
      </p>

        Escobar highlights the <i>decentering</i> necessary as a precursor to
        pluriversality. The neoliberal expansion of the 1990s centered a
        homogenous form of social organization as the driver of global
        capitalism, displacing other forms of being, knowing, and producing. To
        Escobar, aiming for post-capitalism or post-development does not mean
        immediately aiming for these constructs to cease to exist. Instead, he
        advocates for a displacement of their centrality, to make way for a
        mosaic of communal, alternative, and autonomous cultural and economic
        worlds. This can expand the partial common ground and surface area of
        contact between these multiplicities, leading to a world of difference,
        but not disconnection. It is this ethos towards which we hope to bring
        the digital pluriverse.
