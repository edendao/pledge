# Overview

This is an interactive pledge, where contributions are created by readers and visitors by signing a vision with their web3 identity (wallet). Contributions are free-form textual responses that follow provided sentence starters and map to a generative art blob (universe) that represents the contribution in the artistic, space representation of the Eden Dao. Readers are able to contribute and sign their own meanings and creations.

## Wallets

We support wallets through Metamask and WalletConnect.
